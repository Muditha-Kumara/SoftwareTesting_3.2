### 3. Test Scenario & Acceptance Criteria

The following user scenario and acceptance criteria were selected for automated testing:

```yaml
user_scenario:
  description: As a user, I can add a new regular task to the Todo List App.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - The app loads successfully in the browser.
    - The input field (ID: taskInput) and "Add Task" button are present.
    - A new task can be entered and added to the list.
    - The new task appears in the list after submission.
    - Error handling is present for empty input.
```

---

### 4. Selenium Test Plan & Test Cases

The following test plan and cases were derived from the acceptance criteria:

```yaml
test_cases:
  - id: TC1
    description: Add a valid task to the list.
    steps:
      - Open index.html in Chrome using Selenium.
      - Locate the input field and "Add Task" button.
      - Enter "Buy groceries" and click "Add Task".
      - Wait for the new task to appear in the list.
    expected_results:
      - "Buy groceries" appears in the task list.
      - No errors are shown.
    actual_results:
      - Task added and visible in the list.
      - Pass

  - id: TC2
    description: Attempt to add an empty task.
    steps:
      - Leave input field empty and click "Add Task".
    expected_results:
      - Alert or error message is shown.
    actual_results:
      - Alert appears for empty input.
      - Pass
```

### 5. Test Execution & Debugging

All Selenium tests passed successfully. Screenshots for each step and log files were generated as evidence.

#### Environment Preparation
- Python 3.x installed
- Selenium installed via `pip install selenium`
- ChromeDriver downloaded and added to system PATH
- Todo List App files served locally

#### Test Script Summary
- Python script initializes ChromeDriver and opens index.html
- Locates input field and button by ID
- Uses `send_keys` and `click` to add a task
- Implements explicit waits for DOM updates
- Uses assertions to verify task addition
- Configures logging and captures screenshots on error and at each step
- Headless mode tested for CI/CD compatibility

#### Debugging Strategies
- Logging used to capture info and errors
- Screenshots saved on exceptions and after each major step
- Explicit waits used for dynamic elements
- Robust locators (ID, partial text) for reliability

---

### 6. Reflections & Lessons Learned

#### Challenges
- Handling dynamic DOM updates and waits
- Ensuring ChromeDriver compatibility
- Debugging element not found errors

#### Observations
- Explicit waits improve test reliability
- Error handling and logging are essential for debugging
- Headless mode is useful for automation

#### Lessons Learned
- Selenium tests require robust locators and waits
- Debugging tools (logs, screenshots) speed up error resolution
- Preparing for CI/CD integration is valuable

#### Recommendations
- Use more advanced selectors for complex apps
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated test runs
- Compare Selenium with Cypress/Playwright for future improvements

    print('Test failed. See selenium_error.png and selenium_test.log for details.')
finally:
